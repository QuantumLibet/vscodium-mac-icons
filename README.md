### icon history

This is the second time the VSCodium developers and maintainers have decided on a visual change that affects all users.

The first try was with release 1.47.3 on 2020-07-28 with an icon set by https://github.com/cristianovitorino (their user handle being "estatra" at that point in time) and based on the poll https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/issues/313.

After the new version with the updated logo has been released, it did not find everybodys appreciation and was reverted to the original icon in 2020-11-20 the same year. https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/pull/582



The second time the icon was changed was with release 1.77.0.23090 on 2023-04-01 with an icon set by @daiyam.

Initiated as the icons had a different background between Windows and other platforms, the change was the result of the discussion here https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/pull/768, that was oblivious to the discussions of the first try, and the two polls by @daiyam for shape https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1429 and color https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1430. Neither poll respected people who did not want a bright white background, as @daiyam did not offer that choice.
