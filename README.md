### icon history

The original icons were proposed in this thread by [clarsonneur](https://github.com/clarsonneur) and voted upon in [issue 4](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/issues/4).

<br>

The first change of them was with release 1.47.3 on 2020-07-28 with an icon set by [cristianovitorino](https://github.com/cristianovitorino) (their user handle being "estatra" at that point in time) and based on the poll [issue 313](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/issues/313).

After the new version with the updated logo has been released, it did not find everybodys appreciation and was reverted to the original icon in 2020-11-20 the same year with [issue 582](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/pull/582).

<br>

The second time the icon was changed was with release 1.77.0.23090 on 2023-04-01 with an icon set by [daiyam](https://github.com/daiyam).

The change was the result of the discussion here [issue 768](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/pull/768), that was oblivious to the discussions of the first try, and the two polls by @daiyam for [shape](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1429) and [color](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/discussions/1430). Neither poll respected people who did not want a bright white background, as the poster did not offer that choice.
